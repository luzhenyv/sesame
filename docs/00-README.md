### Integration with Source Code

- **Frontend and Backend Placeholders:**  
  In your repository, maintain separate folders for your application’s source code (e.g., `/frontend` and `/backend`). Use internal documentation links (e.g., in **02-Getting-Started.md**) to bridge between code and docs. This keeps the documentation and source code synchronized and easy to navigate.

### Inspiration & Benefits

- **Famous Open Source Projects:**  
  Projects like [Taiga](https://github.com/taigaio) and [OpenProject](https://github.com/opf/openproject) leverage similar consolidated documentation structures to facilitate project management and collaboration. This approach minimizes overhead and ensures that all stakeholders—from developers to end users—can quickly find the information they need.
  
- **Ease of Maintenance:**  
  By merging related topics into single documents (such as combining requirements with feature details and integrating roadmap with iteration planning), you reduce the number of files while maintaining clarity. This is especially useful for agile projects where frequent updates are common.
