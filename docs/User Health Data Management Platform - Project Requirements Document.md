# User Health Data Management Platform - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** User Health Data Collection and Analysis Platform

**Project Goals:**

- Integrate health data at both micro-level (personal health records, family health maps) and macro-level (medical institution databases, healthcare resource repositories, disease characteristic databases)
- Aggregate fragmented health data to enhance health management convenience
- Develop a health management app that supports data aggregation, visualization, analysis, prediction, and limited e-commerce functionalities

**System Architecture:**

- **Client-side:** Mobile (iOS/Android) and web (responsive design)
- **Backend Server:** Core services including data aggregation, storage, analysis, prediction, content management, and user management
- **Third-party Integrations:** Support for interoperability with other health management systems, medical institutions, and payment interfaces for product sales

## 2. Product Positioning and Target Users

**Positioning:** A data-driven health management platform that meets the needs of personal and family health data management, provides chronic disease management and remote monitoring for community doctors, and supports e-commerce functionalities (health product sales) to increase user engagement and platform value.

**Target Users:**

- Individuals concerned about their own and their familyâ€™s health
- Users managing health information for family members (including pets)
- Community or family health managers (e.g., community doctors, caregivers)
- Users needing health data analysis and prediction
